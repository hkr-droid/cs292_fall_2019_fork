# Evaluation

Success will be based on comparing how the synthesized semaphore code scales with increasing the number of threads.  We will base these comparisons off of @ferles2018. Additionally, if the tool used in @ferles2018 is available, we will compare the performance of our generated semaphore code with the generated explicit monitor code.  We will also take care to report the effort required to adapt the paperâ€™s method to semaphores.  Finally, we will compare the semaphores and explicit monitors by the sorts of invariants they accept in their pre and post conditions.
