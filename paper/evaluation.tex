\section{Evaluation}

We evaluate the implementation of \texttt{conimp} on the canonical race condition example. This illustrates the ability for the interpreter to handle concurrency through the \texttt{par} operator. 

\subsection{confirming our example program}
- looks good!
- discussion about differences in end global state, race condition

\subsection{Rosette}
- solve
	- symbolic values, where we can put 'em 
- verify
	- counter example
- synthesize :( 
	- this what we tried and what we want
